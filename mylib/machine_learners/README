These are the C5 machine learner bindings for python.

Download C5 binaries from https://www.rulequest.com/see5-info.html and adjust the path in external.py.

Usage:
    from external import C5
    
    classes = ["Class 1","Class 2"]
    featureNames = ["Length","Age","Is corrupted"]
    featureTypes = [int,      int,  [True,False]]
    X =            [[1,         1,  False], 
                    [90,        4,  False], 
                    [11,        11, False]]
    y = ["Class 1", "Class 2", "Class 2"]
    
    ml = C5(classes, featureNames, featureTypes)
    ml.fit(X,y)
    ml.score(X,y)
    ml.printErrorMatrix()
    ml.getAccuracy()
