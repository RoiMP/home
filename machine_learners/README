Download C5 binaries from https://www.rulequest.com/see5-info.html and adjust the path in external.py.

Usage:
    from external import C5
    
    X = [[1,1,False], [90,4,False], [11,11,False]]
    y = ["Class 1", "Class 2", "Class 2"]
    
    ml = C5(["Class 1","Class 2"],
            ["Length","Age","Is human"],
            [int, int, bool]
           )
    ml.fit(X,y)
    ml.score(X,y)
    ml.printErrorMatrix()
    ml.getAccuracy()
